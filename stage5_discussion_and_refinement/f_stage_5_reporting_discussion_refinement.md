# F. Discussion of Evaluation Results


# Refinement List

- Searching for a book in the home screen now has suggestions and search history.
- Searching in the search screen now updates the results as the search is being made.
- The buttons for editing the profile are easier to be clicked on.
- Posting a book now has a clearer aknowledgement message.
- Search results can be ordered by user rating or by the date of posting.
- Most screens now have the bottom app bar, so going back to the main menu is less clicks away.
- ISBN insertion is more straightforward (the hyphens are added automatically )
