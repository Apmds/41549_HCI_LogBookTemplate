## Interview
    
### Tell me about your free time. What do you like to do?
I like reading, listening to music, being with my family, drawing and cooking.

### Do you usually read books?
Yes.

### How do you discover new books to read? / How do you usually get new books?
At the moment it is through the <u>literature teacher</u>, or <u>Instagram</u> (people who share the books they read and who evaluate them)
or <u>friends</u> who send books they think i would like to read.

### Tell me about the last time you read a book.
I'm reading a book offered for Christmas "The Stranger" by Albert Camus (Nobel Prize for Literature).
It's an interesting descriptive book, with details that no one would remember to write.

### Do you collect books, or are you mainly interested in reading new ones?
A little of both. I buy books because i find them interesting, because they are aesthetically beautiful to be on my shelf, 
but sometimes i don't read them, even though i want ot read them.
Usually it's because <u>i want to read new books</u>.

### When you finish reading a book, what do you do with it? Do you keep it if you want to read again in the future?
I <u>keep most of the books</u> (emotional attachment), but some i could lend or give away.

### If you had extra books at home, would you be more likely to sell, donate, or trade them? Why?
<u>Exchange</u>, because i could read another interesting book, and not spend money.
A book ends up depreciating in terms of price due to it's use.


### Have you ever traded books with others before? 
No.
		
### Do you ever re-read books?
Yes, once or twice.

### Have you ever thought about trading books before? Why or why not?
No, <u>I've never found anyone with the same literary style</u>, but I've already lent it to someone and the other person also lent it to me (it's not really a exchange).

### What's the biggest reason you haven't traded books before?
<u>Difficulty finding someone with the same literary taste.</u>
I have no desire to exchange books with people with different tastes.

### What would make you hesitant to trade a book with someone else?
May the person damage the book.
I don't trust the person, that is, if they will treat the book well.

### Would you feel confortable trading a book with strangers, or would you prefer only friends?
I would prefer to only exchange books with people that i knew, but at the same time, <u>
    with unknown people it would be easier to find books
    that i would like
</u>.
But i would feel comfortable exchanging, but only with people I know.

### What could make you want to trade books?
<u>The desire to read new books if that speaks louder than the fear of changing a book</u> (someone could damage it...).
There are books i wouldn't mind exchanging.
Some would be difficult to trade with someone because <u>I like them and want the books on my shelf</u>.

### Would you trust an app to suggest book trades for you based on your interests, or do you prefer to pick them manually?
<u>I would like to have suggestions</u>, because I could come up with the idea for a book, but then i could find another book that might pique my interest more.

### If you were unsure about a trade, what extra info would help you decide?
<u>Rating of the person</u> i'm exchanging with (rating system).
If that person is someone who takes good care of books.
What is the <u>condition of the book</u> I intend to exchange.

### Do you think it's better to trade books in person with others or send them?
<u>I would prefer person to person, but it can be difficult</u> if it is with someone from far away.
So would prefer to send it.

### Would you be open to shipping books, or do you prefer only local trades? Why?
<u>I'm interesting in exchanging with people from different locations</u>.
I don't know other foreign authors, it could be a good opportunity to increase my knowledge.

### What would make you recommend a book trading app to a friend?
The fact that you can <u>exchange books easily and safely</u>.

### What does it mean to you to exchange books in an easy and safe way?
Switching from person to person has the issue of security. A carrier may be safer.
Ensure that the <u>books reach both customers in good condition</u>.
<u>I've never heard of any similar app</u>, this might be a good point to recommend it to a friend.
