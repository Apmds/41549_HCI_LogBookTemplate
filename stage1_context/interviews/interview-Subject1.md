## Task Overview 

**How do you usually get/discover new books?**
- In the library and in bookstores, by reading the back cover.

**When you finish reading a book you bought, what do you do with it?** 
- I just keep them at home.

**Do you ever re-read books?** 
- Not usually, but having them at home makes them able to be read again. 

**Have you ever though about trading books with other people? Why or why not?**
- It never occured to me, besides, I just like to have them.
Since most books I read come from the library, I almost only buy the books I really want now.
But there are some books that I don't have a big connection with, so those I could consider trading with someone else. 

**What qualities would you be looking for when looking for a book to trade with?**
- I would look for a clean book, that looks good and within the genre of books I'm looking for.

**Would you search for specific books or in a more broad category (genre)?**
- I would try to look for books that fit my interests, but I would simply look for what is available and if it would interest me.

**Would you trust an app to give you book recomendations based on your interests?**
- Yes, of course.

**Would you be confortable trading books with strangers, or only with a group of people you know?**
- Yes, since I already read books from the library that have been handled by multiple other people.
