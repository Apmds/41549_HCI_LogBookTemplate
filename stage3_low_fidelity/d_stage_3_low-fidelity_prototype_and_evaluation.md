# Low Fidelity Prototype and Evaluation

Tasks:
 - "You are a bookworm and love science fiction, romance and suspense books, update your favorite genres."

 - "Make the book Perry Mason - The Case of the Demure Defendant (ISBN 978-8186734896) available for other people to see, mentioning that you prefer to meet at Fórum Aveiro to exchange it and that it has no physical defects, adding a photo of the cover and another photo of the back cover."

 - "Find out if the book The Hobbit is available and if it is, take a closer look at the post with the highest ratings, send a "Hello!" to the owner of the book and propose an exchange. This exchange will be for the book you just made available, for today (April 1st) at 3:30 pm at the Aveiro Forum."

 - "Are you looking for the book "Na Rota de Vasco da Gama - Uma Aventura em Portugal" by Gerónimo Stilton to read? If you can't find it, register it in the app so you'll be reminded when someone makes it available."

 - "Someone sent you a message! See who it was, what they said, and respond accordingly."

## D.2. Prototype Evaluation

With the prototype evaluation, we found certain things that need to be changed or/and improved:
- New messages on top (on the chat screen)
- Chat icon indication if new messages
- Indicate better which book is ours (selecting book to trade)
- Add to wishlist by profile
- Indicate better which book belongs to each user
- Better genre selection (maybe a checkbox)
- Optional notes at the end, when posting a book
- Search for location (not only select on the map)
- Feedback when selecting favorite genres
- It's not clear if the books in the feed are ours or not
- It's better to display the isbn dashes in the textfield, to help the user confirm
- After enter the isbn, know imediatly the book, to know if it's the correct one
- Choose more than one book to trade
- Allow the other person to see our books and choose which ones tehy want to exchange
- Bigger icons
- Search icon is a bit hidden
- **Some confusion choosing the book to trade**
