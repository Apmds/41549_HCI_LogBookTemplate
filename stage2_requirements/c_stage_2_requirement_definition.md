# Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Exploring local literature in Buenos Aires
## **[INACABADO]**
Emma Walton, a travel blogger and book lover, is visiting Buenos Aires, Argentina, for two weeks, for explore its literary and cultural heritage. She has heard that Buenos Aires has a deep literary history, with famous authors like *Jorge Luis Borges*, and she wants to dive into their works. She visits El Ateneo Grand Splendid, a famous book store hoping to find a book by an Argentine author in English. But since she is always traveling, it's difficult to carry many books with her, so she prefers to exchange a book from her last trip instead of buying a new one.

As she walks into the bookstore, she receives a notification from the book trading app, letting her know that another traveler nearby has a copy of *Ficciones* available for exchange. Curious, she checks the user's profile and sees that he is a literature student from 
Germany who is also exploring Argentina. They chat through the app and agree to meet at a nearby cafe later to swap books.

While in the bookstore, she goes into the app and searches for the book *Ficciones*. A few results appear and she chooses one, which happens to be by a literature student from Germany who is also exploring Argentina. They chat through the app and agree to meet at a nearby cafe later to swap books.


## Scenario 2: Peter drops off a book
Since Peter works late hours, meeting up with people to trade books becomes tricky. When searching for an interesting book, he finds out that the app has special **drop-off spots** - locations such as cafÃ©s or grocery shops.

After finding a book that seemed interesting, he struck a deal by offering one of his old detective novels in the trade. They then decided to use one of the cities cafÃ©s as the drop-off spot, each giving an estimate of when they could **deliver** the books there. After an agreement was made, the trade was scheduled.

The next day, Peter decides to leave in the morning to deliver his book to the cafÃ©. After arriving, he **confirms his identity** to the attendant and leaves his novel with them. Later in the afternoon, his phone recieves a **notification** - the book he was to recieve in the trade has arrived in the cafÃ© and is ready to be **picked up**. So, before going to work, he passes by the cafÃ© to pick up his new book. The cashier asks him again for his identity and hands him the book, making him recieve **another notification** on his phone that the trade was completed successfully.


## Scenario 1: Maria goes on a Museum Tour

[Maria had always loved modern art, but she often found museum visits overwhelmingâ€”so many exhibits, so much information, and little guidance on where to start. Today, she was visiting a contemporary art museum that had recently introduced an **interactive guide**.  ]

[As she entered the museum, Maria received a notification on her phone, reminding her to launch the app. She opened it and was greeted with a personalized welcome screen. The system, aware of her general interests in **digital media and abstract art**, suggested a self-guided tour tailored to her preferences.  ]

[Curious, Maria followed the suggested path. As she approached the first painting, the guide vibrated slightlyâ€”a prompt that additional content was available. Holding up the guide, she saw an **overlay** appear on the screen, revealing a time-lapse animation of the artist creating the piece. A small **audio clip** played, explaining the artistâ€™s thought process and influences. Maria found this fascinating; it was as if the artwork was coming to life in front of her.  ]

[As she continued her tour, Maria **bookmarked** her favorite pieces, leaving notes about what she found intriguing. The system, recognizing her engagement, suggested another exhibit nearby featuring similar themes. Midway through her visit, she received a pop-up asking if sheâ€™d like a **short quiz** on the artworks she had explored, offering an interactive way to reflect on what she had learned.  ]
