**Name:** Peter Smith  
**Age:** 58  
**Occupation:** Bartender  
**Location:** Quebec, Canada 

## Background  
Peter is a canadian bartender and has been working on his job in Quebec for the last 25 years. He has some interest in reading, but as his job requires him to work long hours, he does not have very much time to himself, so he usually spends most of his time watching sports or listening to music, saving a small window to catch up on his current read. Before he had a full time job, he used to enjoy reading detective fiction books, reading up to twenty-five a year, but now he only ends up reading five, at most. He used to buy all the books he wanted to read, but now he mostly gets them from the library, as he does not see much value in collecting books.  


## Daily Life  
Peter's day typically starts at 10am, after getting ready. His mornings are usually spent at home, getting housework done and chilling out before lunch, which he eats at home. Before going to work at 15, he does a mix of continuing his most recent book and scrolling through Facebook and playing time wasters on his phone, going out to the grocery store to stock up his home and to the library to return his book and pick another one up, if he is done with the last. During work, he enjoys spending time serving and talking to his customers, since he knows almost every one. His shift ends at midnight and he finishes his day at 1am.

## Goals & Needs  
Peter wants to find a simple way to give his old books new life, while freeing up their space and having other books of his favourite genre to read.

## Pain Points & Challenges    
- As his schedule is different from most people, he may find it more difficult to schedule a good time to trade with the other person.
- Since his use of technology is somewhat limited, he needs a very simple and straightforward interface.

## Motivation  
Peter is looking to have his old books be useful again, while still having time to relax during the day and having new books to read.
