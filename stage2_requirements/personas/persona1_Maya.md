## Background  
Maya is a 22-year-old university student studying Engineering at a prominent Jakarta-based university. Growing up in a family of educators, she has always been surrounded by books, knowledge, and the idea of academic excellence. However, Maya doesn't come from a wealthy background, so purchasing all the required textbooks for her courses has often been a challenge. She’s proactive and resourceful, often looking for alternatives like second-hand books, digital versions, or even borrowing from friends. Her academic journey has been marked by determination, especially as she balances her studies with part-time work as a freelance web developer. Maya dreams of developing innovative tech solutions that can solve real-world problems, particularly in education.

## Daily Life  
Maya’s day starts early with her checking her phone for notifications, messages from classmates, and updates on her assignments. She often relies on digital tools like Google Calendar to manage her day, juggling lectures, study sessions, and her part-time freelance work. After classes, she meets with her study group, where they often exchange notes and study materials. However, finding the right textbooks is always a hassle. Sometimes she finds that a book she needs is unavailable at the library or out of her budget to buy. Maya spends time browsing online platforms for second-hand books or exploring PDF versions, though not all are reliable or legal.

She wishes there was a more efficient way to swap textbooks with others who need them. Time is precious to her, and the stress of finding the right resources only adds to her already heavy workload.

## Goals & Needs  
Maya’s main goal is to excel in her studies while managing her finances. She hopes to find a more sustainable way to access textbooks without having to spend excessive amounts of money. She wants an easier way to connect with fellow students to exchange textbooks, helping to reduce the financial burden.
